title: Time report for 2019-3-18
---


This is a summary of what I have done between 2019-03-04 and 2019-03-17.

At the most broad scale, here is the proportion of time I have spent working across four different categories: for UWIN, for those in UWI, for those in the Conservation & Science department, and external collaborations.

Within each of these categories, I have worked with 10 clients. Split across these clients my last two weeks looked like:

I worked on 17 projects. My time split amongst them was:

Of the projects that I work on there are 11 that I believe will result in publication.

Here is the last I have worked on each of these projects:
