An important part of understanding regression is wrapping your head around the probability distributions that are used to fit different types of models to data. Simply put, probability distributions are mathematical functions that provide the probability of occurrence for different outcomes of an experiment, and we use them because they have proven to be helpful. Arguably, one of the best-known probability distributions is the normal distribution, which resembles a bell curve:

And often follows this notation:

$$Normal(\mu, \sigma)$$

The normal distribution consists of two parameters, <span>$$\mu$$</span> and <span>$$\sigma$$</span>, which respectively represent the mean and standard deviation of this probability distribution. In more general terms, <span>$$\mu$$</span> could be called a location parameter, which often indicates the mean, median, or mode of a statistical distribution while <span>$$\sigma$$</span> is a scale parameter. Scale parameters indicate the spread of a distribution and the larger the scale parameter the more spread out the distribution. 

While it is possible for <span>$$\mu$$</span> to be any number between <span>$$-\infty$$</span> and <span>$$\infty$$</span>,  <span>$$\sigma \geq 0$$.

Depending on the type of data or what the experiment is, you may be encouraged to use different types of probability distributions.

These probability distributions have been found to be useful in predicting different types of
