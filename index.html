    Hi. I'm an ecologist who works at the Urban Wildlife Institute at the Lincoln Park Zoo.
    My research is in biodiversity informatics. I integrate large and complex data sources,
    develop novel quantitative techniques, and fiddle around on computers an awful lot to 
    determine how biodiversity responds to environmental change across multiple spatiotemporal scales. 
    I'm interested in understanding ecological principles in urban environments and, through my research, 
    look for ways to leverage the vast data sources that exist in cities to answer pressing
    ecological issues. I believe that cities are an important and often overlooked portion of the landscape
    that can be use toward conserving biodiversity.
    <br /><br />
    I am also the analytics advisor for the Urban Wildlife Information Network
    (<a href = "https://urbanwildlifeinfo.org/" >UWIN</a>), which is an international network of researchers who systematically collect data on urban wildlife distributions. In this role
    I steer database management across UWIN and provide statistical support as
    needed.
