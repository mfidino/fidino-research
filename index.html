    I am an ecologist who works at the Urban Wildlife Institute at the Lincoln
    Park Zoo in Chicago, Illinois. I have interests in urban ecology,
    statistics, camera trapping, and programming. My research often includes
    most, if not all, of these elements. I believe that cities are an important
    and often overlooked portion of the landscape that can be used toward
    conserving biodiversity. <br /><br />
    I am also the analytics advisor for the Urban Wildlife Information Network
    (UWIN), which is an international network of researchers who are
    systematically collecting data on urban wildlife distributions. In this role
    I steer database management across UWIN and provide statistical support as
    needed.
