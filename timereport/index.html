    This page contains reports that track how much time I spend on different
    projects to make it easier for me to shift my priorities from week to week.
    I track the time I spend on different tasks with
    <a href="https://clockify.me/tracker">clockify</a>. I then created a suite
    of <code>R</code> functions to collect these data through the clockify api,
    summarize my time spent, and auto-generate a markdown file that reports on
    what I have worked on. I generate these reports every other Monday.
